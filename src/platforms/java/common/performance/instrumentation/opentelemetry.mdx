You can configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

There are multiple ways of combining OpenTelemetry and Sentry.

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` with auto initialization

By default, if you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined. If either of those is set, `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` will initialize Sentry automatically and you don't have to perform any setup work besides configuring your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate`.

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` without auto initialization

You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as environment variable. This means you will either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, for example Spring Boot, or initialize Sentry manually.

## Using OpenTelemetry without any Java Agent

When manually initializing OpenTelemetry you have to register a few Sentry classes.
