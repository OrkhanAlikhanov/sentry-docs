In case you are using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` without needing to use any OpenTelemetry exporters you can add
the following environment variables to turn off exporters and stop seeing error messages about
servers not being reachable in the logs.

Example log message:
```
ERROR io.opentelemetry.exporter.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter - Failed to export spans. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:4317
ERROR io.opentelemetry.exporter.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter - Failed to export metrics. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:4317
```

#### Traces

To turn off exporting of traces you can set `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` as environment variable
see [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).

#### Metrics

To turn off exporting of metrics you can set `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` as environment variable
see [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).
